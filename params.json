{"name":"Judge's Dilemma","tagline":"A revamp of the \"Prisoner's Dilemma\"","body":"# Can you earn parole?\r\n\r\n## The Prisoner's Dilemma\r\n\r\nTraditionally, when faced with this philosophical challenge it is one of game theory.  This version is no different, except you face an artificial judge implemented as an algorithm.  The ability to earn parole is not one of changing the judge, but rather teaching it you are \"good\" and \"not a risk.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules are in the program, and the game is conducted by \"consulting\" this buffer in an SWI-Prolog IDE, and then quering it and teaching it how you are \"good\" and deserve the decision to be paroled.\r\n\r\nAs with all judges, the default response is not to parole you, you have to earn it and prove yourself.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n![Paroled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920498/61188180-a769-11e5-8ea9-40a601c44a00.png)\r\n\r\n![Paroled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920499/616adc64-a769-11e5-9728-362fc86ee49e.png)\r\n\r\n![Paroled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920500/61afe1ec-a769-11e5-865d-0ec2f7ea6111.png)\r\n\r\n![Paroled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920501/61b0a7c6-a769-11e5-8117-38d537d3474b.png)\r\n\r\n![Paroled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920502/61b558ca-a769-11e5-871c-fac0a5f3a5bf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![No Parole](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16355974/11920504/65eac830-a769-11e5-9aa6-d726e18ed5e8.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
